### Types
- `M` : [[Topological Manifold]] of dimension 1
### Statement
`M` has a [[Regular CW Complex|regular]] [[CW Decomposition]].
### Proof
[[Manifolds Have Countable Basis of Regular Coordinate Balls]], let $\left\{ U_{i} \right\}_{i\in I}$ be the [[countable]] [[basis]] of `M` that consists of [[regular coordinate ball]]s. Each $U_i$ is a [[Regular CW Complex|regular]] 1-[[cell]] and an [[open set]] of `M`, the boundary of its closure consists of exactly 2 points. For $n\in\mathbb{N}$ let $M_n=\bigcup\limits_{k=1}^{n}\overline{U_{k}}$, then $M=\bigcup\limits_{n\in\mathbb{N}}M_{n}$.
To construct a [[CW Decomposition]] of `M`, we construct a finite [[regular cell]] decomposition $\mathcal{E_{n}}$ of each subset $M_n$, in such a way that $M_{n-1}$ is a [[subcomplex]] of $M_n$. Begin by letting $\mathcal{E}_{1}$ be the collection consisting of open 1-cell $U_{1}$ and the two boundary points of its closure. This is a regular [[cell decomposition]] of $M_{1}$. Now let $n \ge 1$, and suppose by induction that for each $i=1,2,\cdots,n$ that we have defined a finite regular cell decomposition $\mathcal{E}_{1}$ of $M_{i}$ such that $M_{i-1}$ is a [[subcomplex]] of $M_{i}$. We will prove the inductive step now.
Consider the next [[coordinate ball]] $U_{n+1}$. Some of the finitely many 0-cells of $\mathcal{E}_{n}$ might lie in $U_{n+1}$.
We obtain a cell decomposition $\mathscr{C}$ of $\overline{U_{n+1}}$ by letting the 0-cells of $\mathscr{C}$ be those that lie in $U_{n}$ together with the two boundary points of $\overline{U_{n+1}}$, and letting the 1-cell be the intervening open intervals.
We will prove that each cell of $\mathscr{C}$ is contained in a cell of $\mathcal{E}_{n}$, or is disjoint from the all the cells of $\mathcal{E}_{n}$. This is obvious for 0-cells. Let $c\in\mathscr{C}$ be a 1-cell. c cannot intersect 0-cells because $\mathscr{C}$ is a cell decomposition, and thus it is a [[partition]]. Suppose there is a 1-cell $e\in\mathcal{E}$ such that $e\cap c\ne\varnothing$, As $c$ has no boundary points of $e$ because it contains no 0-cells, then $e\cap c=\overline{e}\cap c$. Since $e$ is open in $M$ and $\overline{e}$ is closed in $M$, it followed that $e\cap c$ is both open and closed in $M$. But $c$ is connected (it is homeomorphic to an open 1-ball since it is a 1-cell, and [[Continuity Preserves Connectedness]]), thus $e\cap c=c$, so $c\in e$.
Now let $\mathcal{E}_{n+1}$ be the union of $\mathcal{E_{n}}$ together with the collection of all the cells in $\mathscr{C}$ that are not contained in any of the cells of $\mathcal{E}_{n}$. Then $M_{n+1}$ is the [[Disjoint Union Space|disjoint union]] of the cells in $\mathcal{E}_{n+1}$ by construction. The boundary of each new 1-cell is a pair of 0-cells in $\mathcal{E}_{n+1}$ (either those from $\mathcal{E}_{n}$ or those that were added). Therefore, $\mathcal{E_{n+1}}$ is a finite regular cell decomposition of $M_{n+1}$. Also, $M_{n}\subset M_{n+1}$ is a [[subcomplex]] because it is a union of the cells in $\mathcal{E}_{n}$, and contains the closures of all its cells because it is [[compact space|compact]]. Thus, the induction is complete.
Let $\mathcal{E}=\bigcup\limits_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\mathcal{E}_{n}$. The cells in $\mathcal{E}$ are pairwise disjoint because any two cells lie in some $\mathcal{E}_{n}$, and their union is $M$. If $x$ is any point of $M$, there is some n such that $x\in U_{n}\subset M_{n}$. Our construction ensures that all the cells of $\mathcal{E}-\mathcal{E}_{n}$ are disjoint from $M_{n}$, and thus $U_{n}$ is a neighborhood of $x$ that intersects no cells of $\mathcal{E}$ except those in the finite subcomplex $\mathcal{E}_n$. Therefore, $\mathcal{E}$ is locally finite. Both the conditions (C) and (W) follow from local finiteness, so this is the required regular [[CW Decomposition]].
